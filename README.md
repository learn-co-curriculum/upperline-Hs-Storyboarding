## Story Time

A storyboard is basically exactly what it sounds like, its a graphical representation of what a story will look like. In the case of a "Choose Your Own Adventure" story, you're story board will need to be able to fork off repeatedly in different directions. 

Because of that, weâ€™re going to use Gliffy to build a flowchart. 


###Steps:

**1.** Spend some time coming up with your opening sentence. It's the most important sentence of the story. If it's not intriguing, users won't want to continue.


**2.** What about the text for each different option? The text for the two different paths needs to be short. You want to intrigue your reader with a glimpse of where the paths will lead them, without giving it all away until they click and choose.
